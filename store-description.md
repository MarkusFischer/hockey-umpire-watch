## Usage

After starting the app, the watch starts in quarter 1 with 15 minutes playtime remaining. 
You start and stop the clock with the start/stop button.  Then the play time runs down, and the game minute goes up. 
The back button starts the penalty corner clock preparation time. Per default this is set to 40 seconds, with a first notification after 30 seconds. The back button stops this clock again. If you stoped the playtime during/before you start the penalty corner clock the preperation time gets automatically stopped when you resume the playtime.
After a quarter expired you get a notification and the time and a up-running clock starts to allow you to monitor the pause time. Pressing the start/stop button stops this clock and the watch switches automatically to the next quarter.

All times can be configured, see Customization.

### Player suspension 

To suspend a player, short press the up button. Then a menu opens where you can select the type of the suspension (green card, yellow card). For yellow cards there are three time presets (per default 5, 10 and 15 minutes), configurable in the menu.
After selecting the type of the suspension, you can insert the jersy number of the player. Additionally there is a field for the home team (H) or the guest team (G). 

The suspension time starts automatically when the play time is resumed. When the time expires you get a notification. The next expiring suspension is displayed on the bottom of the screen. When you stop the time, all suspensions times will be stopped too.

You can navigate the menus with the up and down buttons and confirm a action with the start/stop button or go back with the back button. 

### Customization

To customize the number of periodes, the playtime for each period and the countdown for the preparation of a Penalty Corner use the settings menu provided by the Garmin Connect IQ app. 
In the same way, you can customize the penalty time for a player suspension. There are four presets available, one for the green card and three for yellow cards.
